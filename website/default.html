  <div class="wrapper-aboutme">
<p> I am a Philly girl, born and raised in Fishtown, Philadelphia. I went to high school at Science Leadership Academy. I dreamed of getting out of Philly, but quickly realized that Philly was my favorite city and I decided to attend Drexel University. </p>

<p>I am a Marketing and Entrepreneurship duel major, with a minor in Intactive Digital Media. My first co-op was in Brooklyn, NY where I worked for a small jewelry company as their social media and marketing intern for 6 months. For my second co-op I decided to stay in Philadelphia and work at Connectify Inc., a networking software company as their social media and affiliate marketing manager. </p>
      
<p>I draw my personal inspiration from others, whether it's through social media or from the people I meet. I find that I am on the more creative side of marketing, not so much the number and statistical side. </p>
