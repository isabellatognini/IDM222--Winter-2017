  <h2>Co-op Projects</h2>
  <p>My last internship was at a software company called Connectify Inc. Here are some of the blog posts I wrote while working for them.</p>


 <h3>Puppies, Babies, and Connectify: A Great Way to Make New Friends</h3>
  <p>
On July 11, USA Today posted an article about how to turn your airplane tray into a mobile office, and Connectify Hotspot was mentioned. They reference comedian Dan Nainan, who wrote an article for The Points Guy saying, “Let’s say you want to connect to the Internet on your laptop, your phone and your tablet. Unfortunately, in-flight Wi-Fi systems such as Gogo only allow you to connect one device at a time. A fantastic workaround is Connectify. You install this free program on your laptop, and voilà — you can share your Wi-Fi with multiple devices. This utility is also quite useful in hotels or airports where you can only connect one device to the Internet.” </p>
<p>
Dan also mentions it’s a great way to meet friends and network on airplanes, “If I’m sitting next to somebody nice and we hit it off, I’ll let them share my connection. And believe me, if you share your connection with the flight attendants, they’ll instantly be your best friends!” (USA Today) </p>

 <h3>Keep cool, calm, and connected with Eau Thermale Avene and Connectify Hotspot</h3>
  <p>Connectify has taken a step into the world of beauty. Who would have guessed – a cosmetic company and a software company joining forces. We are living proof that anything can happen. Eau Thermale Avène is known for their skin products made for sensitive or irritated skin. They have been featured in publications such as Vogue Magazine, Allure Magazine, Harper’s Bazaar, The Wall Street Journal and many more!</p>
  <p>
    Eau Thermale Avène has been preparing gift boxes for beauty editors and we’ve included Connectify Hotspot and Speedify licenses for these fancy people. We’re super excited to share our apps with folks all over the world! It’s times like this when we realize that our software can be useful to so many people, no matter what they do for a living. Everyone deserves to be connected with Connectify and we look forward to seeing more and more people reaping the benefits of faster Internet with Speedify, too. But what better way to enjoy fast Internet than with Avène Thermal Spring Water all the way from the Cevennes Mountain in France? </p>

 <h3>Breaking the Divide Between Wi-Fi and Cellular</h3>
  <p>Since Wi-Fi is a local area network (LAN), it can only provide Internet access within a short range. Devices can exchange data to the internet using 2.4 GHz UHF and 5 GHz SHF radio waves. This means that bandwidth is very high, which allows users to do pretty much anything they want on their devices, from checking emails to streaming videos. </p>
  <p>
    As stated in the above table, Celluar can cover a wide range, even entire countries at this point. When you’re searching on your web browser or checking Facebook, you are consuming data. It can potentially be just as fast as Wi-Fi, but can be way more expensive. Cell phone frequencies vary depending on provider, but many phones have both 3G and 4G LTE. 3G frequencies are usually between 800 and 1900 MHz, and can handle talk, text, and basic Internet functions. 4G LTE frequencies are a little different than 3G. 4G LTE started in the late 2000’s and is compatible with 3G, which means that it can handle talk, text, and data-heavy Internet. It’s frequencies are classified by Bands, which are groupings of radio frequencies used by mobile networks. Many mobile networks support up to 4 bands, ranging from 700 MHz (Band 12) to 2100 MHz (Band 4). </p>
