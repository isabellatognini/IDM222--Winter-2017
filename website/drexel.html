  <p>Below are three papers I wrote for my Shakespeare class with Professor Neilson. Enjoy.</p>

 <h3>Hoffman’s Dream</h3>
	<p> Shakespeare’s Nick Bottom, in A Midsummer Night’s Dream comes off as vain and overbearing. He is constantly speaking his mind and wanting everything to go his way. Shakespeare leaves the audience to believe that Bottom is narcissistic man, who believes he can do anything, like perform every role in Peter Quince’s play, “The most lamentable comedy, and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.” Then again, it is the director’s call on how each character should be portrayed. In Michael Hoffman’s, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, through the use of an added character and visual emotions, Bottoms character, played Kevin Kline can be seen as more of a dreamer to who longs to be in a world of fantasy. </p>
<p>
In the beginning of Act 1, scene 2, the camera strolls around the marketplace, displaying all the townspeople. Most of them are dressed in earthy colors, very typical clothing for the common people. When the camera reaches Bottom, he is dressed in clean and handsome white suit and admires himself in the coffee shop window. At first, this makes him look like he is in the upper class and it is clear he feels good about himself, especially when two women admire him. But it is his wife who gives away his true identity, when she comes in dressed like everyone else. Hoffman emphasizes Bottom's pretensions as he apes those who belong to the social class above his own (Frank). At this point, it is clear he enjoys being noticed and being the center of attention, especially when he presents himself as someone higher up than he is, even though he is just a weaver. </p>
<p>
The directorial choice that most prominently disrupts Bottom's fantasy is Bottom's wife, a shrew whose "beady eyes search the square" where Bottom promenades and flirts (Jones on Hoffman). Her presence in the film causes Bottom to abruptly retract from his fantasies. She enters the scene interrogating townspeople and asking, “Where’s my husband? Where’s that worthless dreamer?” as she looks frantically around with her hands looking more like claws. After she says this, it is obvious that the director wants the audience to know that Bottom is a dreamer, living in his own fantasy. </p>
<p>
Bottom hides and runs away from his wife to join the group of actors, where he is warmly welcomed. Just as in Shakespeare’s play, Bottom instructs Quince on how to present the play to the group, “You were best to call them generally, man by man, according to the script.” (1.2.2-3) When he receives his part, he steps away from the group and recites some lines, gaining the interest of civilians who clap after his performance. Then Francis Flute is given his part of Thisby, where Bottom jumps in, asking to play Thisby, then he recites in a high-pitched voice the part of Thisby. Even after Quince says no, the people watching had followed him and clapped after his second performance. Again, when Snug is given his part as the lion, Bottom turns to his audience and roars, until wine is poured on him by two boys, and the audience’s applause quickly turns to laughter. Hoffman uses this slapstick strategy to depose Bottom from his pretentious stance (Frank). He is humiliated and is again taken back to reality. It is when he is most engaged in theater that Hoffman cuts him down (Jones). It seems to be that whenever he is in a world other than his own, it when Bottom is most enthusiastic. Hoffman’s choice to constantly embarrass Bottom helps viewers understand his character as a dreamer who longs to be someone else, someone better and more accomplished than he. </p>
<p>
In the play when Quince says, “You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a sweet-faced man; a proper man as one shall see in a summer’s day; a most lovely gentlemanlike man: therefore you must needs play Pyramus.” (1.2.85-89) may comes off as him just trying to convince Bottom to play the part, like it was an order. In the film, Quince comes off as kind and sympathetic for the humiliated Bottom. After Bottom accepted his role as Pyramus, he leaves the players disheveled and uneasy, despite his enthusiasm and confidence up until this point. When he returns home, he sneaks into him room to avoid his wife. When his wife comes into the room, she stands there silently with a disapproving look on her face. Bottom has to go home to encounter the wife whose silence and marginality more profoundly extend and complicate the comic discomfiture that he has experienced in the piazza (Jones). This helps the audience understand bottom as someone to just wants to be free from his current self. </p>
<p>
Bottom lives in a world and time where material and social expectations become more prominent with genders. The white suit he wears symbolized the class and stature he wishes to be apart of, though it is interesting that the suit inevitably gets ruined. When Bottoms wife turns her bake on him, he looks down in helplessness and her silence shames Bottom (Jones). Bottoms wife becomes a prominent role in the film, especially when it comes to understanding Bottoms character. He truly lives a very barren life, which lacks substance and love. Knowing that Bottom is in a marriage without love makes his actions and pretentiousness seem like their more caused by the absence of support. Hoffman clearly wants the audience to feel sympathetic towards Bottom as opposed to making his character the laughing stock of the play. </p>
<p>
Hoffman’s choice to add a character in his version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream substantially affected the way we understood Bottom. He made Bottom a character for the audience to relate to and to feel sorry for. Bottom becomes someone who deserved pity from everyone, including the other characters in the play. His part becomes the backbone of the film, which helps an audience understand the connection between fantasy and reality, a paradox that many in the film have to deal with. </p>

 <h3>Red Handed</h3>
	<p>In Shakespeare’s Macbeth, Lady Macbeth is the fiercest character in the play. The first time the audience sees her; she is ambitious and already planning on how to kill King Duncan for her own self-improvement. Not only is she a strong character, but also in most instances she is gutsier than her male counterparts.  In theater it is important to help define a character by their costumes and since Shakespeare leaves a lot of space for a director to present a character to the audience. In Alexander Burns’ Macbeth, Lady Macbeth’s (played by Judith Lightfoot Clarke) costumes directly reflect her character throughout the play. Through the use of colors, specifically red on Lady Macbeth’s part, it shows the motions that she goes through, from being a strong-minded woman to her death. </p>
  <p>
    When the audience first sees Clarke’s character, she comes out wearing a robe with red embroidery and a white undergarment under it as she reads Macbeths letter. While she says, “Come, you spirits that tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here, and fill me from the crown to the toe, top-full of direst cruelty! Make thick my blood, stop up the access and passage of remorse,” (1.5.41-46) she closes her robe as if to hide the white undergarment. The color white signifies purity and innocence and by covering her undergarment, it makes it look as if she wants to forget about her innocence and be strong so that she can help her husband claim the throne. </p>
    <p>
    Through the use of costumes, it helps the audience identify who certain characters are and how they should feel about them. Costumes have often been an actor’s or a professional troupe’s most valuable property (Banham). All other characters are wearing more earthy colors or black, while Lady Macbeth is almost always wearing red throughout the play. Her character stands out to everyone and she is automatically identified as a strong character and the backbone of Macbeth’s actions. Through the use of red as her characters main attire, it signifies that she is strong willed and confident. It is an interesting choice to chose such a strong color for Lady Macbeth, because in Elizabethan times, only royalty could wear the color purple and only the highest nobility could wear the color red (Alchin). It made her character look like she always wanted to be royalty, always wanted to be someone at the top and strong. It’s clear she does not want to be seen as just a woman, but the lady of the house. </p>
    <p>
    In Act 1, Scene 6, when King Duncan comes to stay at Macbeth’s castle, Lady Macbeth comes out in a long red dress, with long sleeves. Red often symbolizes power and ruthlessness. Even more blatantly obvious costume decision, she is then more determined to go through with killing the King. As she said, “I would, while It was smiling in my face, have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums, and dashed the brains out, has I so sworn as you have done to this,” (1.7.56-59) she pulled the torso of her dress away from her chest. It was clear that she was embracing her strength and the power that she was able to show, while Macbeth contemplated what he wanted to do. </p>
    <p>
    In Act 2, Scene 3 after Macbeth killed King Duncan, Lady Macbeth takes the daggers from Macbeth’s hands to take to the Kings guards, and she comes back with bloody hands and says, “My hands are of your color, But I shame to wear a heart so white,” (2.3.61-63) while she wipes the blood off on her dress. The blood blended in with her dress and it made it look like Lady Macbeth was not as guilty as Macbeth, because she was able to hide her guilt in her dress. But it also made her look more invulnerable, in that she was unbothered by the sight of blood.</p>

    <p>
    With a change in costume, in Act 5, Lady Macbeth comes out in just her white undergarment as she sleepwalks. The whole scene is Lady Macbeth trying to get out a spot that she sees on her hand and how she remarks that, “The Thane of Fife had a wife. Where is she now? What, will these hands never be clean?” (5.1.45-46) Going back to when she said, “But I shame to wear a heart so white,” she is almost contradicting herself now, and so is her costume. She went from being very ambitious and confident, while wearing crimson red, to falling apart and wearing just her white undergarment. She is not strong anymore and her costume is reflecting that. </p>
    <p>
    Lady Macbeth is a strong character and deserves a strong costume to go along with it. Burns made an astute choice in making Lady Macbeth’s costumes an important part of her character. The wardrobe showed her rise and her fall in the tragedy. The colors directly reflected her strength and personality throughout the play. It helped the audience understand who she was and how she was able to manipulate her husband to commit murder. Lady Macbeth’s wardrobe was a vital part in this version of Macbeth and really helped make the play more dramatic. </p>

 <h3>A Tragic Hero</h3>
	 <p>In Shakespeare’s, Hamlet, tragedy strikes every character and aspect in the play. Hamlet’s character experiences some life events that cause him to seek revenge. With Hamlet in the forefront of this play, it is easy to call him a hero, when he aims to kill his uncle, King Claudius, for murdering his father, King Hamlet. By instantly giving Claudius the role of the villain, Hamlet also procures the role of the hero. But certain actions make it clear that Hamlet does not fit the typical role of a hero. Shakespeare makes Hamlet more of an anti-hero by making Claudius’ and Gertrude’s relationship important in how audience views Hamlet’s character and by giving Hamlet a very melancholy personality. </p>

    <p> In the beginning of the play it is clear that Hamlet is upset about his father’s death, but even more upset that his mother got married to his uncle so quickly after his father’s death. Hamlet continues to wear black as both his mother and uncle try to talk him out of his mournfulness. “Good Hamlet, cast thy knighted color off …. Thou know’st ‘tis common; all lives must die, Passing through nature to eternity.” (1.2.68-73) Hamlet strikes back that he should mourn his father and that his clothing reflects his grief. Then Claudius provides support for Hamlet by explaining, “your father lost a father, that father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound … To reason most absurd, whose common theme is death of fathers.” (1.2.89-103) Claudius positions himself as a mighty and compelling father figure to Hamlet (Berger). He convinces Hamlet that he is loved and cared for, which makes it look like Claudius genuinely cares for Hamlet. Both Claudius and Gertrude convince him to stay in Denmark, rather than go back to Wittenberg. </p>

    <p> Claudius has given Hamlet all the elements of a real father; love, sympathy, and most importantly, he told Hamlet that he is the heir to the throne, “You are the most immediate to our throne, And with no less nobility of love, Than that which dearest father bears his son, Do I impart on you.” (1.2.109-112) Despite all these kind works, Hamlet refuses Claudius to be his father and continues to blame his mother for their speedy marriage. For Hamlet, it is about avenging his father. This is what makes Hamlet a “hero” in the eyes of the audience, but the way he goes about it challenges his heroicness. The deciding factor that causes him to seek revenge on Claudius was Claudius’ reaction to seeing the play inside of a play. Buoyed up by the success of the ruse of the play and determined on action, he decides to spare the King as he prays, but moments later, finding him in the ignominious position of eavesdropper in Gertrude's closet, he kills him, and discovers it is Polonius he has struck (Edwards). This mistake triggers an onslaught of tragedy. He thought Polonius was the King, which is why he killed him. The fact he shared no remorse for his actions, but went right into comparing his deed to his mothers actions, “A bloody deed – almost as bad, good Mother, as kill a king, and marry with his brother.” (3.4.29) </p>

    <p> It is clear that the relationship between Claudius and Gertrude is important. Gertrude supports Claudius and turns Hamlet away when he tries to convince her that Claudius killed his father. Now that Polonius is dead, Hamlet may no longer be seen as a hero. Though his intentions were righteous in that he thought he was killing the King, he is now seen as a murderer and a threat to many people. Hamlet acted through impulse, rather than thinking about his actions first; this is what makes him an anti-hero. His character is no longer as likable, based on his actions. This warning, therefore, speaks from the rash act: Let no rational being give up control to impulse which cannot see, cannot distinguish, the nature of a deed (Denton). While his intentions are noble, if he continues to act through impulse, then he falls into the guilty party. </p>
    
    <p> Gertrude continues to ally herself with the King by telling him about Hamlet killing Polonius. Gertrude and the King agree to send Hamlet away to England. Again, this shows the audience that they believe that Hamlet is at fault and that having him around makes him dangerous. Obviously, Claudius and Gertrude have different reasons. At this point, Claudius thinks he will let everyone know that he killed Hamlets father, and sets up plans to kill Hamlet while he is in England. Even when Claudius is seen as a villain, he continues to act sympathetic towards Hamlet and even helps Laertes avenge his father’s death. <p>

    <p>As a hero, he kills Claudius. He also is forgiven by Laertes for killing Polonius. Hamlet succeeds in avenging his father, but along the way he kills Ophelia, Gertrude, Polonius, Laertes, and even himself. He was never a kind person during the time the audience sees him, he was always thinking negatively and all his actions were based on impulse. Even in death; Hamlet gives his kingdom to Fortinbras, a foreigner. While all of his actions seem noble, it is hard to give him the credit of a hero, but it is fair to say he lost himself in the ambition to seek justice.</p>

<p>“Now cracks a noble heart. – Good-night sweet prince.” (5.2.360) </p>
